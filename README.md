## JWT Authentication Service

Building the authentication service for the YouTube Video Aggregator project. It's a JWT-based authentication server which uses Redis (for Session Store), integrated with the backend API and the frontend UI which allows a user to:
- Follow 5 YouTube channels by default (on successful login)
- Follow and unfollow channels that other users have added
- Fetch all of the latest videos from the channels they follow

<br>

- [YouTube Video Aggregator](https://github.com/siddhant-vij/YouTube-Video-Aggregator) to fetch the latest videos from the YouTube channels.
- [Dynamic Feed Generator](https://github.com/siddhant-vij/Dynamic-Feed-Generator) using Go's template engine to display the videos.

<br>

RSS/Atom feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. You can use this project to keep up with your favorite youtube channels!

### ðŸš€ Learning Goals
- How to integrate a Go server with PostgreSQL
- The basics of database migrations
- Long-running service workers
- The complete overview of JWT authentication
- Dynamic feed generator using the backend API

<br>

### ðŸš€ Improvement Ideas
- Support different options for sorting and filtering posts using query parameters
- Support multiple types of RSS feeds with better logging and error handling (e.g. Atom, JSON, etc.)
- Classify different types of feeds and posts (e.g. blog, podcast, video, etc.)
- Support pagination of the endpoints that can return many items
- Add a CLI client that uses the API to fetch and display posts, maybe it even allows you to read them in your terminal
- Scrape lists of feeds themselves from a third-party site that aggregates feed URLs (e.g. FeedSpot, etc.)
- Add integration tests that use the API to create, read, update, and delete feeds and posts
- Add bookmarking or "liking" to posts
- Create a comprehensive web UI that uses the backend API
